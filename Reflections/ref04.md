We like cheap and powerful things

### What was good?
I find interesting the challanged, for me I was wondering how to sync multiple devices, after the lab and the class I finally understood how this works on a simple base using the broker.

Also I found interesting how this router could also serve as a server for the borker.


### What was difficult, where did you struggle?
Networking was a little bit challengi to set up on the router but at least Martin had plenty of experience with it so it was more chill.

### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration? Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 
We connect with an other team broker, then they start sending us the by messages a whole book jajaja.

### How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
As always pretty good, I felt maybe this class a little bit of tension between the teachers, as they start getitng into conflit of how to teach the class or the concepts.

### Help and extra work
  - **Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?** : Pretty good! 
  - **Who did you help, gave feedback to?** :  Nop, just on the team 
  - **Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?** : No needed.
