Here are all the reflections, one for each class session.
Make sure you plan some time (<10min) on the day of the session
to remember interesting points of the session.

They will be named ref01.md to refnn.md

As a reminder, we expect the following in a reflection:

## Refecltion Class 3
### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice? Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
#### One Wire

* Scam - two wires
* Small projects
* Use asmall capacitors to store charge
* Speed 16.3
* Max LengthL 100m - 300m
Uses:
* Single wire thermostat
* NFC

#### R2S

* 9 to 25 wires
* Min 3 wires
* Transmite data
* Receive Data
* Ground
* Speed 20 Kbs
* Max length: 15 m

#### Rs485

* Wires : 2 - 4
* Speed: 10 Mbit/s
* Max length: 1200m
* Special properties: High immunity tagainst electrical noise
* Usage: Industry - Automation - Computer
* New versions can connect up to 32 devices

#### CAN

* Control Area network
* Use heavily on medical solutions
* Wres: Can high - Dominant signal Can LOW - Recessive
* Speed: 1.0 Mbtis
* The maximum number of devices, theoretically, is 254

#### I2C

* Integrated something
* Wires: Data, Clock, Master/ slaves
* I3C - New version
* We can control Displays
* Standarize sensor comunication.
* Special properties: You could change the speed and the range, but as faster the low the data transmited and the low bi comunication
* Advantages: Data is faster to transmite: 100Kbits - 20 Mbits, Typical voltages used are +5 V or +3.3 V

### What was good?
I love the hands-on mini projects; they are challenging, but I feel advancing on the field is.

### What was difficult, where did you struggle?
So far, so good; ofc it took me time to understand and to advance, but the TAs always help me!

### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration? Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 
At lot! the M5 was the most dificult one to configure, we decided to go with buttons because it was hard to set up the M5.

### How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
So far, so good.

### Help and extra work
  - **Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?** : Yes, he always check and support us. 
  - **Who did you help, gave feedback to?** :  Noone this time.
  - **Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?** : Nope, we did a presentation but the presenter was another person.
