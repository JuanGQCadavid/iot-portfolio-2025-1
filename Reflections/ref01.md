What is your takeaway, what do you want to remember, and what would be your advice? Take-away can be a small summary, but better outstanding points.

TLDR:

* Node-RED is so helpful for defining and configuring service communication rules!
* MQTT serves for communication when multiple devices are publishing data that could be used on other services; by defining channels over the broker, communication across devices becomes easier.
* When doing demos, the next things could fail:
* * connectivity
* * security
* * Backup: Things could fail at demos; what could we do as a backup plan?
* * It is physically big: How can we simplify the elements of the solution?
* * Automatization: Manual steps to configure the solution could lead to human mistakes

I really love the field; in my bachelor, I used to play a lot with electronics and embedded systems; during that time, I developed an obsession of programming all, the server, the communication, everything... so when I heard about we will work with the Node-RED, I thought at first I would lose the control over my solution on the final project, but once I used it, I saw the power (and feel too!) to simplify my life over procedures that required a lot of time and are more mechanical, so I will not longer need to stress about defining a lot of the protocols and initial set up for Intercommunication but rather I could focus on building from well-standardized protocols and procedures proposed by Node-RED. Hence, a productivity bootstrap would help me to develop a better solution.

What was good?
The class is more student-focused; I feel that the teacher and teacher assistants really take the student as a human being; in the middle of the lab, I feel more like playing with some components than being on an exam/evaluation. The TA were always motivating us not only to learn but also to push our limits and try different things, we ended up hacking some teams deceives (Ups jajaja)

What was difficult, where did you struggle?
So far, so good; understanding the platform was tricky, but once you got familiar with how to connect things, it got better.

Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration? Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?
Usually, I reached out to the TA during the lab for doubts regarding the lab but also more about what is going on under the hood. Fun was the hacking activity; we managed to understand more about how things work thanks to it! Our TA motivates us to do it, and I love it!

How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
Excellent!

Help and extra work
Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable? Of course! It was pretty good!
Who did you help, gave feedback to?: - I help Mini, she was a little bit lost, but she ended up achieving her goals
Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?: Not needed.
