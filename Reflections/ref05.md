## Refecltion Class 5
### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice? Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
In general the class was for working on the mini projects, I like it the idea of being able to keep working on the pub sub protocol as it gaves me an idea of how things connect, also the mini project all together helps me to see the power of many subs one pubs.

### What was good?
See comunication protocols in action.

### What was difficult, where did you struggle?
So far so good.

### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration? Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 
So far so good.

### How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
So far so good.

### Help and extra work
  - **Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?** : Yes, as always. 
  - **Who did you help, gave feedback to?** :  We did not reach for help this time.
  - **Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?** : No needed.
